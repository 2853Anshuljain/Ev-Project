## 📊 Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Collection

* Used the **EV Population dataset** containing registration records, vehicle specifications, and geographic data.

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values and standardized data formats.
* Filtered relevant columns for analysis (make, model year, vehicle type, range, county, city).

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Visualized trends in EV adoption, popular manufacturers, and range improvements.
* Compared BEVs vs. PHEVs across different regions and years.

### 4️⃣ Forecasting Model

* Applied **curve fitting** using *SciPy’s exponential model* to project future EV registrations.
* Generated predictions up to **2030** based on trends up to 2023.

### 5️⃣ Visualization

* Created seven clear, insight-rich visualizations:

  1. EV Adoption Over Time
  2. Top Cities and Counties by Registrations
  3. Distribution of EV Types
  4. Top 10 EV Manufacturers
  5. Top Models in Leading Makes
  6. Electric Range Distribution
  7. Estimated EV Market Growth
